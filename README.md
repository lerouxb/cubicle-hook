# cubicle-hook

This was designed to hang a clipboard against a cubicle wall, but it is made in
openscad and completely parametric, so you can easily adjust it to fit
whatever.

See the [thing on thingiverse](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:714607) for
photos.

# Build Instructions

Use OpenSCAD to turn this into an STL file, then use your favourite slicer to
turn that into GCODE and then whatever is your preferred method to feed that to
your 3D printer.

# Assembly and Usage

Just slip the hook over the top of the wall and hang your thing over the hook.
